# carto-create-workflow

CARTO Workflows is a visual DAG authoring app that compiles to warehouse SQL. Each workflow runs *inside* a connected warehouse — no CARTO compute is involved at execution time. This skill covers the full lifecycle: building the DAG (the bulk of this file), operating it via the CLI (CRUD, schedules), and **cross-profile copy** (`dev → prod` promotion, customer-segregated workspaces via `carto workflows copy`) — see the references below.

> **Workflows vs Builder — distinct apps.** This skill targets **Workflows** (CARTO's DAG/orchestration app, `/workflows/<id>` in the URL). **Builder** is the separate **map**-authoring app (`/builder/<id>`). When this skill mentions "the Workflows canvas", "in Workflows", or "the DAG view", that is never Builder — they're different products that share an org and connections but nothing else. Workflow output (a result table with geometry) is typically visualised in Builder afterward; that's the only place the two apps connect.

For one-off ad-hoc SQL, use [`carto-query-datawarehouse`](../carto-query-datawarehouse) — workflows are for repeatable, scheduled, multi-step DAGs.

Bundle structure, component schemas, input formats, and gotchas are all served by the CLI — **never hardcode or assume them**. The CLI is the source of truth.

Live introspection commands (use these before reaching for any reference file):

| Command | What it serves |
|---|---|
| `carto workflows schema` | Index of all bundle/DAG schema sections |
| `carto workflows schema bundle` | Top-level bundle shape (id, title, connectionId, config, privacy, tags). `privacy` is a `$ref` — fetch its shape with `carto workflows schema privacy`. Minimal valid form: `"privacy": { "privacy": "private" }` (the inner string is *not* a bare `"private"` — `enums` lists the allowed values for that inner field). |
| `carto workflows schema config` | Full DAG config (schemaVersion, connectionProvider enum, nodes, edges, variables, viewport, useCache, executionSettings, schedule) |
| `carto workflows schema node` | Generic node shape, including `data.version` requirement and `data.title` vs `data.label` |
| `carto workflows schema node.source` | Source/`ReadTable` node shape and the `data.id == data.inputs[0].value` invariant |
| `carto workflows schema node.customsql` | Full customsql node spec |
| `carto workflows schema customsql` | Copy-paste customsql node template (with `version: "2.0.0"`) |
| `carto workflows schema edge` | Edge shape |
| `carto workflows schema handles` | **Edge handle naming reference** — sourceHandle/targetHandle by node type, by operator, by component. Critical for valid edges. Each `targetHandle` you wire must also be **declared as an input** in the target node's `data.inputs` (`value: null` when wire-fed) or the canvas draws no line — see the [declare-edge-fed-inputs](#declare-edge-fed-inputs) rule. |
| `carto workflows schema variable` | Variable (parameter) shape — `{ order, name, type, value, public }` |
| `carto workflows schema schedule` | Declarative schedule metadata fields |
| `carto workflows schema enums` | All valid enums (node types, providers, privacies, schedule frequencies) |
| `carto workflows components list --connection <conn> --json` | Component catalog for the connected warehouse |
| `carto workflows components get <names> --connection <conn> --json` | Per-component `inputs`, `outputs`, `notes` |
| `carto workflows components get <names> --connection <conn> --input-formats --json` | Input-type `format`, `examples`, `pitfalls` |
| `carto workflows --help` | Full command reference, including schedule-expression dialects per engine |

> **`connectionProvider` must match the connection.** `config.connectionProvider` (enum in `schema enums`) must match the connection's actual provider — mismatches generate the wrong SQL dialect and error at runtime. Look it up with `carto connections list --search <name> --json` (`connections get` requires a UUID).

---

## Development process

**Follow these 6 phases in order for every workflow request.** Do not skip or reorder them.

### Phase 1 — Gather information

1. **Identify data sources.** If the user named tables, note them. Otherwise discover what's available with `carto connections list` and `carto connections describe <connection> "<fqn>"`.
2. **Clarify the goal.** What transformation? What output? What filters/conditions?
3. **Determine the connection.** `carto connections list | head -n 20`. Note its `provider` (`bigquery` / `snowflake` / `databricks`) — you will need it for the next step.
4. **Read the provider reference.**

   <critical-rule id="read-provider-reference">
   Before writing any node, you MUST open `references/providers/<provider>.md` (e.g. `references/providers/bigquery.md`) and read it end-to-end. This is non-negotiable.

   <why>It contains identifier-quoting rules, column-casing behaviour, Analytics Toolbox path, schedule-expression dialect, and customsql `$a`/`$b` placeholder requirements that `validate` cannot catch. These only surface later as `verify-remote` failures or runtime SQL errors, and are the single most common cause of late-stage rework.</why>

   <do-not>Do not skip this step because the next phases look concrete. Do not rely on memory of a previous run — provider files change.</do-not>
   </critical-rule>
5. **Fetch the component catalog.** `carto workflows components list --connection <connection> --json` — your only source of truth for component names.

### Phase 2 — Design the approach

1. **Select components** from the catalog you fetched.
2. **Fetch schemas for every component you plan to use.** `carto workflows components get <name1>,<name2>,<name3> --connection <connection> --json` returns `inputs`, `outputs`, and `notes`. Read the `notes` array carefully — it contains gotchas.
3. **Fetch input type formats.** `carto workflows components get <component1>,<component2> --connection <connection> --input-formats --json` returns `format`, `examples`, and `pitfalls` for each input/output type. Pass **component names** (e.g. `native.buffer`), NOT input-type names.
4. **Design principles:**
   - Preserve identifier and spatial columns throughout.
   - **Prefer native components over `native.customsql`. This is not a soft preference.** See [Native-first rule](#native-first-rule).
   - H3/Quadbin columns work for visualization without geometry extraction.
   - Use standard names for visualization: `geom`, `h3`, `quadbin`.

### Phase 3 — Present plan, surface gaps, confirm

Present the workflow plan (components, data flow, decisions). Then **explicitly enumerate every gap** before building:

- **Unresolved parameters** — thresholds, radii, filter values, time windows, k for k-NN, aggregation columns, output table names, etc.
- **Analytical decisions left to the user** — significance levels, distance metrics, join types, null-handling, dedup keys, CRS, H3/quadbin resolution.
- **Ambiguities in the request** — anything where you had to guess intent.

For each gap, **propose a sensible default with its rationale** (e.g. "p-value threshold: suggest `0.05` — conventional significance level", "buffer distance: suggest `1000m` — matches the city-block scale of the input"), and **ask the user to confirm or override**. Never silently pick a value for a user-facing analytical parameter. **Wait for confirmation** before building.

### Phase 4 — Build the workflow

1. Create the workflow file. Get the bundle/node/edge/variable shapes from `carto workflows schema [section]` (start with `bundle`, then `node`, `node.source`, `node.customsql`, `edge`, `handles`). For customsql nodes, copy the template from `carto workflows schema customsql`.

   If you set the optional top-level `privacy`, it must be an **object**, not a string: `"privacy": { "privacy": "private" }` (the field name nests). Omit the field entirely if you don't need it — `"privacy": "private"` will fail `validate`.

   **Source nodes** (`type: "source"`) — treat `ReadTable` like any other component: fetch its spec with `carto workflows components get ReadTable --connection <conn> --json` to get the canonical `inputs[*].title` and `inputs[*].description`. (`ReadTable` is hidden from `components list` because it's grouped `__internal`, but `get` returns it normally.) Two source-only rules `get` cannot tell you, both from `schema node.source`:
   - The canvas display name lives in `data.label`, NOT `data.title`. Generic nodes use `title`; source nodes use `label`.
   - `data.id` and `data.inputs[0].value` must be the same FQN.

   <critical-rule id="declare-edge-fed-inputs">
   **Every input an edge feeds must be declared in the target node's `data.inputs`, with `value: null` when the value arrives over the wire.** The Workflows canvas draws each node's input connection dot from `data.inputs` — an edge whose `targetHandle` has no matching declared input renders **no dot and no connecting line**, even though the engine wires data from `edges` and the workflow runs correctly.

   <why>`validate`, `verify-remote`, and `create` all pass — they check that an edge references a real node, not that the target input is declared. The only symptom is a broken-looking canvas (isolated nodes, missing lines) the user discovers on open, then reports as "it ran but looks broken." This is the single most common report of that class.</why>

   The handle names **are** the input names (`carto workflows schema handles`), so for every edge the target node must carry an input whose `name` equals the edge's `targetHandle`. The reliable habit: when you drop a component, copy **all** its `Table` inputs from `carto workflows components get <name> --json` into `data.inputs`, giving each wire-fed one `"value": null` — don't include only the config inputs you set values for.
   - single-input ops (`native.limit`, `native.buffer`, `native.saveastable`, `native.groupby`, …) → `{ "name": "source", "type": "Table", "value": null }`
   - `native.customsql` → `sourcea`/`sourceb`/`sourcec` (the `carto workflows schema customsql` template already includes them)
   - `native.joinv2` → `lefttable` + `righttable`; `native.spatialjoin` → `maintable` + `secondarytable`; `native.distance` → `main` + `secondary`

   `validate` does not flag this yet, so cross-check it yourself before presenting — every edge's `targetHandle` must appear as an input `name` on that edge's target node:
   ```bash
   jq -r '.config as $c
     | ($c.nodes | map({(.id): [((.data.inputs // [])[].name)]}) | add) as $in
     | $c.edges[] | . as $e
     | select($e.targetHandle and (($in[$e.target] // []) | index($e.targetHandle) | not))
     | "edge \($e.id): target \($e.target) has no input named \"\($e.targetHandle)\" — canvas will not draw this line"' workflow.json
   ```
   No output = clean. Source nodes are exempt — they take no incoming edge; their `data.inputs[0]` holds the FQN (see above).
   </critical-rule>

   **Canvas layout & naming — apply on every node, every workflow.** None of this affects execution, but the user opens the DAG in Workflows and a sloppy canvas reads as low quality. The numbers are small and stable; just apply them.

   - **Snap grid is 16 px.** Every `x` and `y` you write must be `% 16 == 0`. The Workflows canvas snaps drags to this grid; off-grid values look subtly misaligned next to anything the user nudged.
   - **Card widths are fixed by node type:** source nodes render at **192 px** (12 cells), generic components at **64 px** (4 cells). Knowing this is what lets you reason about gaps.
   - **Card heights are fixed:** every component card and source card is **80 px** (5 cells) tall, with a **16 px** label rendered below the card body. The label is not part of the card — it lives in the gap to the next card.
   - **Canonical inter-card gap (right edge → next left edge):** 80 px (5 cells) for tight linear placement; 128 px (8 cells) at a fan-in (a join's left input, where an edge from another row needs room). The *gap* is the constant; left-edge-to-left-edge Δx differs across patterns only because cards have different widths. So a generic→generic linear step is Δx=144 (9 cells); a source→generic step at the same gap is Δx=272 (17 cells); a generic→generic fan-in step is Δx=192 (12 cells).
   - **Canonical vertical gap (card body bottom → next card body top):** 80 px (5 cells), of which the first 16 px is the card's label and the remaining 64 px is whitespace. The label always sits inside the gap, never inside the card. So a stacked-card step is top-to-top **Δy = 160 px (10 cells)** — 80 (body) + 16 (label) + 64 (whitespace).
   - **Layout.** Source nodes stack at the leftmost column with the same `x`, Δy = 144 px (9 cells). The main pipeline runs at the y-midline of the source rows — e.g. sources at y=80 and y=224 → pipeline at y=160. Joins on the midline visually receive both inputs symmetrically.
   - **`data.title` and `data.label` are different fields** — never duplicate. `title` = short instance-specific verb (≤ 15 chars) describing what *this* node does in *this* DAG (`"Rank"`, `"Join to score"`, `"To H3"`). `label` = the component's canonical type name as Workflows shows it on a fresh drop (`"Join"`, `"Create Column"`, `"H3 from GeoPoint"`) — read from `carto workflows components get <name> --json` → `components[0].title`. Source nodes only render `data.label` on canvas (treat it as a short alias for the table: `"Candidates"`, `"Score grid C"`).
2. **Run `validate` after every write to the file.** It's offline, fast, and catches structural errors immediately:
   ```bash
   carto workflows validate workflow.json --json
   ```
   Treat any save without a passing `validate` as broken — fix before continuing to the next node/edge.

   **`validate` is authoritative.** If a component schema from `components get` disagrees with what `validate` accepts, trust `validate` and adjust the bundle to satisfy it. Do not "fix" the bundle to match the schema if it's already passing validation.
3. **Run `verify` at branch boundaries**, not on every save. It hits the warehouse (slower, requires auth), so reserve it for whole sub-DAGs once their structure validates clean, and once at the end before presenting:
   ```bash
   carto workflows verify-remote workflow.json --connection <connection-name> --json
   ```
   `verify` is what catches column-type mismatches, missing tables, and AT resolution — things `validate` cannot see.

   **Reading the response.** Walk `deep.errors` first — anything in there blocks runtime. `deep.warnings` is finer-grained: `COMPONENT_INVALID` items describe runtime concerns (an option the engine doesn't recognize, a column reference that may fail); `SCHEMA_TRACE_SKIPPED` and `VERIFY_SKIPPED` are diagnostic (the static checker punted on this node, not that it's broken). The top-level `valid` aggregates errors **and** warnings, so it can read `false` while the workflow still uploads successfully (`deep.valid: true` with empty `deep.errors`). Treat empty `deep.errors` as the upload gate; treat top-level `valid: false` as "look closer, but probably not blocking."
4. Fix errors silently — don't expose implementation details to the user.
5. Iterate until complete, with both `validate` and a final `verify` clean.

### Phase 5 — Present result

Summarize what was built. Confirm validation success. Wait for user confirmation.

### Phase 6 — Upload to CARTO

1. Ask if the user wants to upload.
2. Upload and provide the URL:
   ```bash
   carto workflows create --file workflow.json --verify
   ```
   The connection comes from `connectionId` inside the bundle — no `--connection` flag here.
3. **Confirm the upload didn't silently drop inputs.** Immediately after `create`, run `carto workflows get <id> --json` and diff `config.nodes[*].data.inputs` against the bundle you uploaded. The engine silently rejects values at save-time when an input fails validation (most commonly a Selection input fed a display label instead of a wire value — see "Display labels vs wire values" in [Fetching component & input information](#fetching-component--input-information)). When this happens, `validate`, `verify-remote` (when `deep.valid: true` with `deep.warnings` only), and `create` all report success; Workflows renders the node with a red error indicator on first open. Any `value` present locally but missing on the server was silently rejected — fix the source bundle and re-upload (don't try to edit on the server).
4. Do NOT auto-execute unless explicitly requested.

## Native-first rule

`native.customsql` is the *last* tool to reach for, not the first. Before writing a customsql node, attempt the native chain. Fall back to customsql only if at least one of these is true:

- The native chain would require **more than ~4-5 nodes** to express the same logic.
- A specific operation has **no native equivalent at all** (verified via `carto workflows components list`).
- The expression genuinely needs raw warehouse SQL (e.g., `ST_UNION_AGG`, `LOGICAL_OR`, `ML.PREDICT`, last-N windowing).

Common operations and their native equivalents — try these first:

| If you'd write SQL like… | Use natives |
|---|---|
| `WHERE x = …` / multi-condition filter | `native.where` (predicate), `native.wheresimplified` (form-based filter UI), `native.spatialfilter` (geometry-based match/unmatch split), `native.select` (column projection) |
| `SELECT a, b, c FROM t` (multi-column projection / rename / multi-expression) | `native.select` (one node, free-form SELECT body) |
| `SELECT ..., expr AS c FROM t` (add **one** computed column) | `native.selectexpression` (one column + one expression per node) |
| `GROUP BY k, SUM(x), AVG(y), COUNT(*)` (single key) | `native.groupby` — `groupby` input is a single `Column`, not multi-column. For multi-key grouping use `native.customsql`. |
| `JOIN ... ON a.k = b.k` (any join type) | `native.joinv2` |
| `JOIN ... ON ST_INTERSECTS / ST_CONTAINS / ST_WITHIN` | `native.spatialjoin` |
| `MIN(ST_DISTANCE(a.geom, b.geom))` across two tables | `native.distance` (augments the **main** table in place with `nearest_id` + `nearest_distance` — rename them per source if you chain two `native.distance` nodes for two reference tables) |
| `ST_BUFFER(geom, d)` | `native.buffer` |
| H3 binning / boundary / center / polyfill | `native.h3frompoint`, `native.h3boundary` (output geometry column is named `<h3col>_geo`, e.g. `index_geo` — **not** `geom`), `native.h3center`, `native.h3polyfill` |
| `ORDER BY ... LIMIT n` | `native.orderby` + `native.limit` |
| z-score / standardization | `native.normalize` |
| weighted composite score | `native.spatialcompositeunsupervised` (weighted/PCA), `native.spatialcompositesupervised` (target-driven) |
| Getis-Ord Gi*, GWR, isolines | `native.getisord`, `native.gwr`, `native.isolines` |
| Save final node to a table | `native.saveastable` |

Signals you're reaching for customsql too early — stop and look for a native chain instead:

- The customsql is just a `WHERE` clause, a single `JOIN`, a `GROUP BY` with one or two aggregates, or a column projection.
- It wraps a single warehouse function (`ST_BUFFER`, `H3_FROMGEOGPOINT`, etc.) for which a dedicated native exists.
- Its only purpose is to project/rename/re-cast columns — use `native.select` (free-form SELECT body, one node) for multiple columns; `native.selectexpression` is for adding a single computed column.
- You're chaining customsql outputs through more customsql nodes — chain natives instead.

When customsql is genuinely the right call, the per-warehouse SQL-dialect footguns live in the matching `references/providers/*.md` (BigQuery backticks, Snowflake casing, Databricks identifiers).

**Customsql schema-trace cascade — misleading "Table X used but not provided" errors.** If `verify-remote` reports `Table "X" used in statement but not provided` for a customsql node whose `sourcea` / `sourceb` are clearly wired, the root cause is almost always an upstream node with a failing schema trace — even a warning-level `COMPONENT_INVALID` on the upstream node is enough to break the cascade and surface on the downstream customsql. Fix the upstream node first; the downstream error will resolve. Do **not** spend cycles rewriting the SQL, swapping backticks, or experimenting with aliases until upstream is clean.

## Fetching component & input information

**Do not rely on memorized component schemas or input formats.** Always fetch live data from the CLI.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `carto workflows components list --connection <conn> --json` | List all available components |
| `carto workflows components get <names> --connection <conn> --json` | Component schemas with `inputs`, `outputs`, and `notes` |
| `carto workflows components get <names> --connection <conn> --input-formats --json` | Input type `format`, `examples`, `pitfalls` for the types those components use |

What to look for in the response:

- **Component `notes`** — gotcha strings: non-obvious behavior, deprecated status, output column naming.
- **Input `format`** — prose describing the expected value shape.
- **Input `examples`** — concrete JSON snippets showing correct usage.
- **Input `pitfalls`** — common mistakes, evaluation order, format quirks.
- **Component `version`** — copy verbatim into the authored node's `data.version` (string). Generic nodes without it are flagged OUTDATED in Workflows.
- **Input `options` (Selection / Enum)** — the engine matches values **exactly**. Copy each option string verbatim — preserve case, never paraphrase or Title-Case (e.g. spatialjoin's `jointype` accepts `"inner"`, not `"Inner"`).
- **Display labels vs wire values.** Some components (e.g. `native.isolines.mode`) carry a separate `optionsText` field for human-readable labels, and `components get --json` may surface those display labels under the `options` key. If `verify-remote` rejects your "verbatim" value with `Valid options: <list>` listing the *opposite case*, the CLI fed you display labels — find the true wire value by cross-referencing a known-good workflow with `carto workflows get <id> --json`. Lowercased / snake_cased forms (`walk`, `public_transport`) are common for v2 components.
- **`verify-remote` may run multiple component versions simultaneously.** If errors and warnings list contradictory "valid options" for the same input (e.g. one accepts `"Walk"`, the other accepts `"walk"`), the engine likely ran both v1 and v2 validators against your node. Trust the version you copied from `components get`, and confirm by uploading a single-node test workflow.

For values that may evolve over time (component versions, bundle/config defaults, enum option lists), treat the CLI's `components get` / `schema` output as the single source of truth — never hardcode values in your own templates. Specifically:

- **`config.schemaVersion`** — read the current default from `carto workflows schema config --json` → `properties.schemaVersion.default`. Today it's `"1.0.0"` (string), but resolve at author time so future bumps don't require a skill update.

## Provider-specific notes

Different warehouses have different SQL dialects, table-naming conventions, and column-casing rules. Always check the matching provider guide:

- [`references/providers/bigquery.md`](references/providers/bigquery.md)
- [`references/providers/snowflake.md`](references/providers/snowflake.md)
- [`references/providers/databricks.md`](references/providers/databricks.md)

Input-type formats (`Table`, `Column`, `ColumnsForJoin`, `SelectColumnAggregation`, etc.) and per-component gotchas (including the "AT components need `verify`, not `validate`" rule) are served by the CLI itself — see [Fetching component & input information](#fetching-component--input-information).

---

## Operating a workflow (after it's built)

Once a workflow exists in CARTO, the CLI exposes CRUD and schedule management. Quick reference:

```bash
# List / inspect
carto workflows list --json
carto workflows get <id>

# Update with edited JSON
carto workflows update <id> --file workflow.json

# Add / remove a schedule
carto workflows schedule add <id> --expression "every day 08:00"
carto workflows schedule remove <id>
```

Always-on guidance:

- **Workflows run on the connection's warehouse.** A workflow with a BigQuery connection cannot use Snowflake-specific SQL.
- **Schedule expression syntax depends on the engine** — natural-language for BQ/CARTO DW (`"every day 08:00"`), cron for Snowflake/Postgres (`"0 8 * * *"`), Quartz cron for Databricks (`"0 0 8 * * ?"`). See [`references/scheduling.md`](references/scheduling.md). Picking the wrong dialect fails at schedule-add time.
- **Copying a workflow across profiles** (dev → prod, customer-segregated workspaces) is covered in [`references/cross-profile-copy.md`](references/cross-profile-copy.md). Schedules don't transfer — see [`references/schedule-readd.md`](references/schedule-readd.md).
- **Deleting a workflow doesn't delete its outputs.** Tables/views the workflow created in the warehouse persist; clean them up with `carto sql job` if needed.
- **`workflows update` replaces the whole DAG.** There's no per-node patch. Always `get` first, edit, then `update`.
- **Workflow execution status** lives in the activity log (`WorkflowRun`, `WorkflowExecutionComplete` event types). For health monitoring of scheduled workflows, query that log via [`carto-query-datawarehouse`](../carto-query-datawarehouse) — see `references/activity-queries.md` in that skill.
