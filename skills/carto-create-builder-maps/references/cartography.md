# Cartography reference — for CARTO maps authored via the `carto-create-builder-maps` skill

> **This is a reference, not a standalone skill.** Read alongside `SKILL.md` in the same directory when composing a CARTO map that needs cartographic decisions. `SKILL.md` is the primary authoring entry point — commands, configuration shape, field reference, validation. This file layers *what to pick* on top (palette family, scale type, basemap pairing) once the agent knows *how to encode* the configuration.

**Audience:** an LLM agent composing or editing a CARTO map configuration via the CARTO CLI. This reference teaches *what to pick* — layer type, channel, scale, palette, basemap, legend — so the resulting map reads well at a glance.

**Scope:** maps authored through the CLI configuration — the same object model Builder renders. Layer types: `tileset`, `h3`, `quadbin`, `heatmapTile`, `clusterTile`, `raster`.

## 0. Before you pick anything — read the data and name the hook

Cartographic choices depend on the data and on what story the map tells. Before any decision below:

**Know the data:**

| Question | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| What geometry does the dataset carry? | `carto connections describe <conn> <table>` — surfaces the geo column, any spatial index, the shape type |
| What columns exist, and what types? | Same `describe` call — note numeric vs. string vs. timestamp vs. boolean |
| Is the measure a count, a rate, a share, a magnitude, a delta, a category? | From the user's prompt + column semantics. Ask if genuinely ambiguous |
| What's the cardinality / shape of the coloring column? | For string: unique-value count. For numeric: min/max, skew |

**Heuristic for skew without running stats:** *counts*, *revenue*, *population*, *incidents*, *visits*, *areas in m²* are almost always right-skewed. *Rates*, *percentages*, *z-scores*, *indices normalised to a population* are usually closer to normal.

**Who's reading this map.** Typically a GIS / Data Analyst at the terminal, not a developer — they read maps at a glance and judge by legibility. Optimise for the glance; don't pile on options just because the schema allows them.

**Name the hook.** Every decision sharpens if you can answer, in one sentence, *what the viewer should take away*. Good: *"Revenue per store is concentrated in the northeast."* Bad: *"Map of stores"* — that's a dataset, not a hook.

**The hook shapes four things:**
1. The layer type (§1) — what renders best for the takeaway.
2. The classification (§3) — emphasise extremes, the middle, or a policy threshold.
3. The palette family (§4) — sequential for magnitude, diverging for signed, qualitative for kinds.
4. The anti-patterns to avoid (§7).

If the user names the measure but not the column (*"map population density by county"*), pick the column that matches semantically and confirm briefly — don't ask them to name it if one is obviously right.

## 1. Pick the layer type

**Most of this is not your call.** The layer type is determined by the **source** — the dataset's type / indexing / geometry.

| Source is… | Layer type | Agent choice? |
|---|---|---|
| A raster (quadbin-backed band store) | `raster` | No |
| An h3-indexed table | `h3` | No |
| A quadbin-indexed table | `quadbin` | No |
| A line tileset | `tileset` | No |
| A polygon tileset | `tileset` | No |
| **A point source** | `tileset` **or** aggregate | **Yes — §1.0** |

Trust the source. If `carto connections describe` reports a quadbin index, the layer is `quadbin` — don't second-guess from column names or user phrasing.

**Only points get the aggregation pathway.** Lines and polygons are always `tileset`. Rasters are always `raster`. H3 / quadbin tables always render at their own layer type.

### 1.0 The one real layer-type decision: what to do with point sources

| Choice | Reach for it when |
|---|---|
| Keep as `tileset` (individual points) | Each point is meaningful on its own. Cardinality ≤ ~50k at target zoom |
| Aggregate to `h3` | **Default for density / "where is X concentrated?"** Cells are quantitative — the legend reads as "events per cell" |
| Aggregate to `quadbin` | Same role as h3, but rectilinear binning is semantically required (satellite grid, integration with quadbin reference data) |
| `heatmapTile` | Only when the intent is the blurred narrative "glow" and the reader is not expected to quantify anything |
| `clusterTile` | High-cardinality point datasets where individuals must stay click-revealable on zoom-in |

**Prefer h3 (or quadbin) over heatmapTile / clusterTile for anything quantitative.** Aggregated cells carry real numbers. Heatmap and cluster compress signal and cost quantitative precision.

**H3 vs. quadbin for agent-chosen aggregation:** default to `h3`. Pick `quadbin` only when the surrounding data ecosystem is already quadbin-indexed.

**Resolution when aggregating, rough h3 guide:**

| Target zoom / extent | h3 resolution |
|---|---|
| Country / continent | 3–4 |
| Region / state | 5–6 |
| City / metropolitan | 7–9 |
| Neighbourhood / street | 10–12 |

### 1.1–1.7 Per-layer capability reference

Given the layer type is fixed, here's what you can style. **Each geometry has independent attribution.**

### 1.1 `tileset` — points

- `radius` or `radiusField` + `radiusRange`
- `filled` — almost always `true`
- `stroked` + `strokeColor` + `strokeColorField` + `thickness` — point outline
- `opacity` — typical range `0.5–0.9`; drop to `0.4–0.6` when points overlap heavily so density reads through blending (see opacity design note in §1.4)
- `customMarkers: true` + `customMarkersUrl` / `customMarkersField` / `customMarkersRange.markerMap`
- `rotationField` — rotate by a numeric column (degrees)

**Default:** `filled: true, radius: 4`.

**Rule: radius = point diameter; size = stroke.** On points, `sizeField` drives stroke width, not diameter.

**No polygon attribution applies to points** — `enable3d`, `heightField`, `wireframe`, `elevationScale` are ignored.

### 1.2 `tileset` — lines

- `thickness` or `sizeField` + `sizeRange`
- `strokeColor` / `colorField` — the line color *is* the stroke
- `lineStyle` (`solid` | `dashed` | `dotted`) + `dashArray` `[dash, gap]` — stroke dash pattern, relative to stroke width (see `layers.md`)
- `opacity` — 0.7–1.0; lines need more opacity than polygons

**Default:** `stroked: true, filled: false, thickness: 2`.

**Width encodes magnitude.** Use `sizeField` + `sizeRange` for numeric line measures. Color encodes category or magnitude.

**Dash encodes status, not magnitude.** `dashed` / `dotted` read as provisional, planned, or secondary — use them for draft/proposed routes, boundaries under revision, or to push a reference network behind the main subject. Don't dash the primary data layer of a single-layer map, and don't dash dense networks — at low zoom the dashes fuse into noise. Default stays `solid`.

### 1.3 `tileset` — polygons

- `filled: true` + `colorField` → choropleth
- `stroked: true` + `strokeColor` + `strokeColorField` + `thickness` → borders (keep thin: 0.5–1 px)
- `lineStyle` + `dashArray` → dashed/dotted borders — status contrast only (provisional / disputed / draft boundaries); keep solid on dense choropleths
- `fillPatternEnabled` + `fillPattern` → hatched / textured fills; tinted by the fill colour, gaps transparent
- `enable3d: true` + `heightField` + `heightRange` + `elevationScale` → extrusion
- `wireframe: true` — wireframe 3D (only with `enable3d: true`)
- `opacity` — typical range `0.4–0.8`; lower when the basemap carries orientation context or you want the layer to recede in the design (see §1.4)

**Default:** `filled: true, opacity: 0.6`.

**Don't extrude rates** (density, percentage, share). See §7.3.

**Stroke on dense choropleths — derive from the fill.** When a choropleth has many small polygons (sub-national admin, postcodes, parcels, h3 / quadbin cells), the default contrasting stroke makes boundaries more prominent than the data. **Bind `strokeColorField` to the same column as `colorField`, on a darker variant of the fill palette with the same break points.** Multiply each fill RGB by ~0.7. Use `thickness: 0.6–0.8`, `strokeOpacity: 0.85–0.95`. See §7.13 for the failure mode.

A contrasting stroke is correct when polygons are large and few (countries on a world map) — each is a distinct entity, not one cell in a distribution.

**Pattern encodes category or exception, not magnitude.** A texture has no natural order, so never use one for a continuous variable — that is the colour ramp's job. Patterns earn their place in two situations: separating nominal categories so they stay distinguishable in greyscale, in print, and for colour-blind readers; and marking ground that carries a condition, which is the long-standing planning convention (hatching for restricted, protected, provisional, or missing-data areas). A hatched polygon reads as *"something applies here"*, which is why it pulls the eye — use that deliberately.

**Patterns need room.** A texture only resolves if the polygon is large enough on screen to show a few repeats. Where the geometry is too small at the zoom the layer is read at, the pattern degrades into noise and the fill colour stops reading; a flat choropleth is the better call there. Judge it by rendered size, not by the kind of geometry.

### 1.4 `h3` — hex cell aggregation

**Source:** h3-indexed table, OR a point source aggregated to h3 (§1.0).

**Why hex:** hexagons avoid orientation bias (all neighbours equidistant).

- `colorField` + `colorAggregation` — long-form aggregations (`average`, not `avg`); numeric: `count` / `sum` / `average` / `maximum` / `minimum` / `stdev` / `variance`; string/boolean/date: `mode` / `any_value`. See [`layers.md`](layers.md).
- `filled`, `stroked`, `thickness`, `opacity` — same as polygons (§1.3)
- `enable3d` + `heightField` + `heightAggregation` → volumetric hex

**Opacity is a design lever — `0.7` is the safe default; deviate when you have a reason.** On cell and polygon layers (h3, quadbin, polygon tilesets, heatmap, cluster), opacity does three jobs:

1. **Lets the basemap breathe** — at default `opacity: 1` the basemap disappears and the map reads as data floating in void.
2. **Sets visual weight and hierarchy** — a saturated `0.9` layer feels heavy and dominant; a `0.5` layer recedes. In multi-layer maps, use opacity to choose which layer the eye lands on first.
3. **Reveals density through overlap** — where features overlap, lower opacity blends them so the eye reads "more here".

**Default to `0.7`** when you have no specific reason to deviate — basemap breathes enough, layer reads as primary. The full range `0.4–0.8` is available when you have a reason:

- `0.4–0.5` when the basemap carries critical orientation (city grid, coastline, roads), when the layer should recede in the design (e.g. background context layer), or when overlap density is itself the signal.
- `0.7–0.8` when the layer is the unambiguous hero and the basemap is purely backdrop.

This applies to every fill layer (see also §1.1 points, §1.3 polygons). The per-layer numbers below are starting points; the `0.7` anchor is the no-context fallback.

**Aggregation heuristic:** `count` for *"how many?"*, `sum` for totalling, `average` for intensity per event, `maximum` for *"worst case in cell"*. String columns: `mode` (most common) or `any_value`.

### 1.5 `quadbin` — square cell aggregation

Everything in §1.4 applies — quadbin and h3 share the same `SpatialIndexLayer` family.

### 1.6 `heatmapTile` and `clusterTile`

Pick over h3 / quadbin only when narrative reasons outweigh the loss of quantitative precision.

**`heatmapTile`** — continuous density surface (quadbin-backed).
- `weightField` (identity scale) + `weightAggregation` set per-record contribution
- `colorRange` sets the gradient
- Suppress the legend — heatmaps are almost always misread quantitatively (§6.1)

**`clusterTile`** — adaptive point clustering.
- `radius`, `radiusRange`, `clusterRadius`
- Cluster size and color can encode separate dimensions (size = count, color = average)

**Opacity:** same design considerations as h3 / quadbin — typical `0.4–0.8`, fit to the layer's role (see §1.4).

### 1.7 `raster`

**Source:** quadbin-backed raster band store.

| `rasterStyleType` | When | Extra config |
|---|---|---|
| `Rgb` | True/false-colour composite | `colorBands`: three `{ band, type, value }` entries — `type: "band"` or `"expression"` (e.g., `(B04-B03)/(B04+B03)` for NDVI) |
| `ColorRange` | Continuous palette on one band | `colorField` + `colorRange` (sequential) |
| `UniqueValues` | Categorical raster (land cover, masks) | `colorField` + `uniqueValuesColorRange` + `uniqueValuesColorScale: "ordinal"` + `uniqueValuesColorDomain` |

**Default to `ColorRange`** for any single-band continuous measure. Reach for `Rgb` only when the data is natively multi-band and the composite is the point.

---

**Legacy types — do not emit.** `point`, `geojson`, `line`, `hexagonId`, `grid`, `hexagon`, `heatmap`, `cluster`, `trip`. The CLI rejects them on create.

---

### 1.8 Layer order — index 0 renders on top

**The first entry in `keplerMapConfig.config.visState.layers` renders on top.** Builder's legend uses the same convention.

> **Heads-up: opposite of standard deck.gl.** Builder reverses the array internally. From the configuration author's POV, **index 0 = top, last index = bottom**.

The cartographic rule: **layers that cover more pixels go to the bottom; sparse features go on top**. Point tilesets are sparse (a dot per record). Polygon tilesets fill only where polygons exist. h3 / quadbin / heatmap / cluster tile the *entire viewport* wall-to-wall. Raster covers everything.

| Array position | Layer shape | Why this position |
|---|---|---|
| **Index 0** (top) | `tileset` points | Sparse — doesn't occlude |
| Index 1 | `tileset` lines | Thin strokes — minimal occlusion |
| Index 2 | `tileset` polygons (`filled: true`) | Fills where polygons exist; partial coverage |
| Index 3 | `h3`, `quadbin`, `heatmapTile`, `clusterTile` | Tiles viewport wall-to-wall at the aggregation level |
| **Last index** (bottom) | `raster` (basemap-like imagery) | Total coverage |

**`layerOrder` overrides the array order.** When `layerOrder` is missing, Builder uses array-index order. The CLI auto-emits `layerOrder` on create.

**Edge case.** A `tileset` polygon with `filled: false` (outline-only) can sit above fill layers without occluding them.

### 1.9 Zoom-aware visibility — show the right layer at the right zoom

`§1.8` decides which layer is on top *at a single zoom*. `§1.9` decides which layer is *visible at all* by zoom level. Enforced via `layer.config.visibilityByZoom: { min, max }` (range `[0, 24]` on CARTO basemaps / `[0, 22]` on Google Maps).

**The point-overplotting trap.** A point `tileset` at zoom 3–8 (country view) collapses every point into the same pixel cluster. Viewers see "lots of stuff" and learn nothing — the most common low-zoom-unreadable failure for point maps.

**Two fixes — pick by data shape:**

**Fix A — hide below the readable zoom.** `visibilityByZoom: { min: <zoom-where-it-becomes-readable>, max: 24 }`. Use when individual features are the point (find-this-store). Below the threshold the absence is correct, not a UX bug.

**Fix B — multi-layer cascade.** Stack layers over the same data with handoff windows: coarse h3 at zoom 0–7, finer aggregation 7–11, points 11–24. The same source drives multiple layers; the SQL or aggregation differs. Use when the narrative is pattern-level at every zoom.

**Admin-boundary cascade** is the same shape on the polygon side: countries 0–4, states 4–7, counties 7–10, tracts 10–24 — separate boundary tileset per granularity, each with its own `visibilityByZoom` band.

**Defaults to author up front:**
- Point `tileset` over a national / global dataset → `visibilityByZoom: { min: 7, max: 24 }` at minimum, OR pair with a low-zoom aggregation companion.
- Admin-boundary maps spanning >2 levels → always emit a per-level cascade.
- `clusterTile` is the runtime alternative — adapts cluster size to zoom in one layer.

**Anti-pattern (see §7.12):** a single point `tileset` always-visible with no `visibilityByZoom` and no aggregated companion, then expecting the viewer to zoom in.

---

## 2. Pick the visual channel

**One measure per channel. Max two channels per layer.** Three is busy; four is unreadable.

| Channel | Drives | Valid on | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `colorField` | Fill color | All tile layers | The *primary* measure |
| `strokeColorField` | Stroke color | Tileset (lines/polygons), h3, quadbin | Secondary measure — rare |
| `sizeField` | Stroke width | Tileset (points/lines), h3, quadbin | Edge thickness — rare |
| `radiusField` | Point diameter | Tileset (points only) | Magnitude on points |
| `heightField` | 3D extrusion height | Tileset (polygons), h3, quadbin | Magnitude when extrusion is justified |
| `weightField` | Heat density weight | heatmapTile | Per-record contribution |
| `customMarkersField` | Icon selection | Tileset (points only) | Categorical → distinct icons |
| `rotationField` | Point rotation (degrees) | Tileset (points only) | Direction (wind, heading, bearing) |

### 2.1 Primary-channel rules

**Color is almost always the right primary channel.** Humans read color faster than size or height.

**Use radius/size when color won't reach:** all points share one category but magnitudes differ; the map already has many coloured layers; the user asked for *"bigger dots where X is higher"*.

**Use height (3D) only when:** the measure is genuinely a volume / stacked quantity (floors, tonnage, count); the camera is tilted; the user explicitly asks. **Never** for rates, percentages, shares, densities, indices, z-scores (§7.3).

### 2.2 Combining channels

| Primary | Secondary | Reads as |
|---|---|---|
| Color | Radius (different column) | Bivariate "what + how much" on points |
| Color | Height (different column) | Volumetric choropleth — only with one being a count |
| Color (category) | Radius (magnitude) | "Kind + size" — strong for business locations |
| Icon (category) | Color (category) | Categorical combined — rare, careful palette |

**Anti-combinations:** color and stroke-color on different columns (visually inseparable); color + height on the same column (redundant); radius + size + color on points (overload).

---

## 3. Classify the data

*"Classification"* = how a continuous numeric column is broken into color bins. The single highest-leverage decision in choropleth / cell cartography.

### 3.1 Scale types

The `colorScale` values to emit — matching what Builder's UI offers:

| Scale | Name | Character |
|---|---|---|
| `quantize` | Equal interval | Equal *value* ranges. Magnitude distance preserved, breaks are round numbers, maps comparable across viewports. **Strong default for bounded data.** |
| `quantile` | Quantile | Equal *count* per class. Rank, not magnitude. Use when the question is *"top-N?"* |
| `custom` + `uiCustomScaleType: "logarithmic"` | Logarithmic | Heavy-tailed across 4+ orders of magnitude |
| `custom` (hand-authored `colorMap`) | Custom thresholds | Domain-specific breakpoints (grades, policy cutoffs, Jenks pre-computed) |
| `ordinal` | Categorical | String fields, or hexColor mode (§4.7) |

If a configuration read back via `get --json` shows `log`, `sqrt`, `linear`, `identity` on a *color* channel, treat it as legacy — Builder's UI doesn't produce those. They're valid for size / height / radius channels.

> **Gotcha: `ordinal` only honours string columns.** If `colorField.type` is `integer` or `real` and `colorScale: "ordinal"`, Builder silently renders `quantize` — the legend shows numeric bins instead of categorical labels. Same for `strokeColorScale` and `sizeScale`. Tier-1 catches this. **Fix:** `CAST(<col> AS STRING)` in source SQL + set `colorField.type: "string"`; or switch to `quantize` with explicit breaks.

### 3.2 Pick `colorScale` by distribution shape AND data meaning

> **`quantile` is NOT the safe default.** Reflexively picking it is the most common scale-choice failure. Pick by data shape AND what you want the viewer to take away.

| Data shape | What viewers should read | `colorScale` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bounded with semantic landmarks** (0–100 scores, 0–1 ratios, percentages, age bands) | Magnitude on a fixed-meaning scale | **`quantize`** + explicit `visualChannels.colorDomain` set to the scale's natural extent (e.g. `[0, 100]`) | Anchored bins, round-number legend, comparable across viewports. Without `colorDomain`, breaks shift as the user pans |
| **Skewed long-tail unbounded** where viewers care about *rank* | Rank | `quantile` | Equal-population bins. Don't pick for bounded scores — breaks become arbitrary |
| **Heavy-tailed across 4+ orders of magnitude** (point density, throughput, financial outliers) | Magnitude on log scale | `custom` + `uiCustomScaleType: "logarithmic"` + log10-spaced `colorMap` | Linear breaks compress the tail; quantile flattens the bulk |
| **Categorical-looking integers** (severity 1/2/3, tier id, status code) | Discrete categories | `CAST(<col> AS STRING)` + `ordinal` | The integers are labels, not magnitudes |

**Default ladder when in doubt:**
1. Bounded / has semantic extent → `quantize` + `colorDomain`.
2. Heavy-tailed across orders of magnitude → `custom` + log10 `colorMap`.
3. Skewed unbounded, viewers want rank → `quantile`.
4. Categorical labels disguised as integers → cast to string + `ordinal`.
5. Stakeholder-agreed breakpoints → `custom` with explicit `colorMap`.
6. String / native categorical → `ordinal`.
7. Hex column → `ordinal` + hexColor mode (§4.7).

**On CARTO-indexed cell datasets (h3, quadbin, pre-aggregated tilesets):** cell counts are frequently log-normal — prefer the logarithmic option before falling back to quantile.

### 3.3 What the runtime does NOT offer as first-class scales

When you need them, pre-compute upstream and emit as `custom` with a `colorMap`:

- **Jenks natural breaks** — minimises within-class variance. Quantile/quantize cover most uses.
- **Standard-deviation classification** — compute the σ-tier column upstream as integer, classify as `ordinal`, or bake into `custom` `colorMap`.

### 3.4 Number of classes

Default to **5**. Drop to 3 for overview / executive maps. Up to 7 for detailed analysis. Past ~7 the ramp blurs in the middle.

### 3.5 Escape hatches

- **Meaningful zero** (change, delta, z-score) → diverging palette (§4.2), optionally centred via `custom` colorMap (§4.3).
- **Categorical but ordered** (low/med/high, A–F) → `ordinal` on the string field, sequential palette so the order reads.
- **One extreme value dominates** → clip the top 1–5% and annotate, or switch to logarithmic.

---

## 4. Pick the palette

**The cartographic principle — match the family to the measure character.** This is foundational thematic cartography (Cynthia Brewer / ColorBrewer / MacEachren). Three families, three data shapes:

- **Qualitative** → unordered categories (kinds, types, names). **Distinct hues.** No implied ordering.
- **Sequential** → ordered magnitude (counts, intensities, scores). **One hue family, light→dark or dark→light.** Implies *more* in one direction.
- **Diverging** → signed deviation around a midpoint (change, z-score, over/under target). **Two hue families meeting at a neutral midpoint.** Implies *zero matters*.

**Crossing families misrepresents the data.** A sequential palette on a string column implies an ordering the data doesn't have. A qualitative palette on a magnitude column loses the *more/less* read. A sequential palette on signed data hides the sign. Pick the family from the data's character; pick the specific palette by fit (basemap tone, colorblind safety, hue connotation).

### 4.1 CARTO palette families

**Qualitative (unordered categories — distinct hues):** `Antique`, `Bold`, `Pastel`, `Prism`, `Safe`, `Vivid`

**Sequential (magnitude — ordered):** `Burg`, `BurgYl`, `RedOr`, `OrYel`, `Peach`, `PinkYl`, `Mint`, `BluGrn`, `DarkMint`, `Emrld`, `BluYl`, `Teal`, `TealGrn`, `Purp`, `PurpOr`, `Sunset`, `Magenta`, `SunsetDark`, `BrwnYl`, `Gray`

**Diverging (signed):** `ArmyRose`, `Fall`, `Geyser`, `Temps`, `TealRose`, `Tropic`, `Earth`

**Colorblind-safe subset** (recommended when audience is public or unknown):
- Qualitative: `Safe`, `Vivid`
- Sequential: `Teal`, `Purp`, `Mint`, `Emrld`, `BluYl`, `DarkMint`
- Diverging: `Temps`, `Geyser`, `Tropic`

### 4.2 Fit the palette to the measure

Once the family is right (§4 principle), the specific palette is a fit decision. Consider in order:

- **Hue connotation.** Warm hues (red, orange) carry *severity / heat / alarm*; cool hues (blue, green) carry *calm / magnitude / safe*; purple is neutral. Reach for the connotation only when the measure supports it — *"risk of flood"* is warm-appropriate, *"population count"* is not.
- **Basemap tone.** Light basemap (positron, voyager) → palettes with a dark high-end stand out. Dark basemap (dark-matter) → palettes with a bright high-end stand out (see §4.4).
- **Colorblind safety.** Use the subset above when audience is public or unknown.
- **Within-map distinguishability.** Multiple layers in one map need different *families*, not different shades of one (§7.11).

**Default if uncertain — one safe pick per family.** When none of the above factors push you to a specific palette, use these as a fallback. They're colorblind-safe, work on light basemaps (default `positron`), and have neutral connotations that don't impose meaning the data may not carry:

| Family | Default if uncertain | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Sequential — magnitude | `Teal` | Colorblind-safe, calm, dark high-end on light basemap |
| Diverging — signed | `Temps` (cool ↔ warm) or `Geyser` | Both colorblind-safe; midpoint reads as neutral |
| Qualitative — 2–6 categories | `Bold` (or `Safe` for colorblind-safety) | Distinct hues, not shades-of-one |
| Qualitative — 7–12 categories | `Prism` or `Pastel` | More distinct hues; collapse to top-N + `Other` past 12 |

**Don't reach for a named palette by reflex.** "What did I use last time?" is the wrong prompt — the answer should be a fresh fit-by-character each map (§7.10). The defaults above are a *fallback when reasoning gives no preference*, not a reflex.

For categorical data, the goal is **distinct hues**. CARTO qualitative palettes are tuned for that. A custom palette is fine as long as adjacent categories are visually separable; shades of one hue are not (that's a sequential palette, and using it for categories implies an order that isn't there).

### 4.3 Centring a diverging palette on zero

If the distribution is roughly symmetric around zero, `quantize` + diverging palette places the middle class near zero by construction — no extra work.

**Explicit centring is worth it when:**

- Distribution is *asymmetric* around zero (mostly positive with a few severe negatives) — one side gets washed out without explicit breakpoints.
- Viewers should pick out the zero class exactly (*"which cells didn't change?"*).
- Side-by-side comparison with another map needs the midpoint anchored.

**If you centre explicitly:** `custom` scale with a `colorMap` pinning zero at the centre. Last entry uses `null` as the catch-all upper bucket — required.

```jsonc
"colorScale": "custom",
"colorRange": {
  "name": "TealRose",
  "category": "CARTO",
  "type": "diverging",
  "colors": ["#009392","#39b185","#9ccb86","#e9e29c","#eeb479","#e88471","#cf597e"],
  "colorMap": [
    [-0.5, "#009392"], [-0.25, "#39b185"], [-0.1, "#9ccb86"],
    [0.1, "#e9e29c"], [0.25, "#eeb479"], [0.5, "#e88471"], [null, "#cf597e"]
  ]
}
```

### 4.4 Dark basemap considerations

CARTOColors sequential palettes are designed light → dark by default. That's correct on *light* basemaps — the pale low-value class disappears into the background, the dark high-value class stands out. On `dark-matter` the rule **inverts**: bright at the high-value end (so they pop), dark at low (recede into basemap).

**Two ways to handle dark:**

1. **Pick a palette whose default order already works on dark** — sequential palettes with a dark low-value end that reads as "background" and a bright high-value end. Several CARTO palettes qualify; check the low end against `#1a1a1a`-ish basemap.
2. **Reverse the palette** — flip `colors[]` so bright sits at the high-value end, OR set `"reversed": true` on `colorRange`.

**On `positron` / `voyager`:** default light→dark order is fine.

**Never pair `dark-matter` with a palette that has a light low-value end UNLESS the "low" class is semantically "absent"** — pale blobs disappearing into dark is only OK if disappearing is intended.

### 4.5 Categorical — too many values

More than 12 categories is unreadable with any palette. **Collapse to top-N by frequency, bucket the rest as `Other`.** If the dataset encodes its own per-category colors in a column, use hexColor mode (§4.7).

> **Two stacking constraints** when `colorScale: "ordinal"` or `"custom"` runs against a high-cardinality string column:
>
> - **Palette length caps distinct-hue count.** When the column has more unique values than the palette has colours, extras fall into Builder's "Others" bucket which renders grey. A 6-colour palette over 25 unique values means 5 distinct + 20 grey — the map looks broken. CARTO qualitative palettes scale up to 12 colours; pick one long enough, or specify `colorRange.colorMap` to control mappings.
>
> - **Legend caps at 20 entries — the map still renders all.** `MAX_LEGEND_ENTRIES = 20` slices the legend; past that, a *"+N more"* message appears. The map colours every feature correctly. When every category must be labelled, collapse to top-19 + `Other`.
>
> Three escape hatches: (1) pick a palette long enough; (2) filter source SQL to top-N upstream; (3) use hexColor mode (§4.7) when the data carries its own colour.

### 4.6 Custom palettes and borrowing

`colorRange.name` and `category` must match the runtime's registry or the legend breaks. For a one-off palette:

- Keep `name` pointing to a real CARTO palette (e.g., `Teal`)
- Replace `colors` with your custom array
- Optionally set `colorMap` for exact thresholds
- The runtime renders the colors provided; the legend resolves by name

Set `category` only to `CARTO`, `ColorBrewer`, `Uber`, or an account-palette category confirmed to exist.

**When to reach for a non-CARTO ramp:**

- Need a **perceptually-uniform** ramp — paste **Viridis** or **Cividis** hex into `colors[]` and keep `name` on a nearest CARTO entry.
- Stakeholder agreed on a **ColorBrewer** palette — same lineage as CARTO (both from Brewer). Paste hex into `colors[]`; keep `name` on a real CARTO entry.

Don't invent palettes ad-hoc — luminance ordering, colorblind safety, and print legibility all need checking.

### 4.7 Hex-color columns — palette-free coloring from the data

When the dataset carries its own hex column (or a SQL query projects one), the runtime can colour features directly. Right tool when colour *is* part of the data's meaning: brand colours, regulatory traffic-light indicators, team colours.

**Requirements:**
- A column with valid CSS hex strings (`"#FF5733"`); malformed/null falls back to grey.
- Column present in the source or projected by `customSql` / `querySource`.
- **Color channels only** (`colorField` / `strokeColorField`) — not size / radius / height / weight / rotation.

**Configuration shape:**

```jsonc
"visualChannels": {
  "colorField": {
    "name": "product_category",     // label column — legend shows these
    "type": "string",
    "colorColumn": "brand_hex"      // hex-value column — actual fill
  },
  "colorScale": "ordinal"
},
"visConfig": {
  "colorRange": {
    "hexColor": true,
    "name": "Custom", "category": "Custom", "type": "custom",
    "colors": []                    // runtime fills from the query
  }
}
```

`colorScale` stays `ordinal`. The legend pairs each unique `name` with its `colorColumn` value via `GROUP BY name, colorColumn`.

**Use when:** domain-required colors (brand, regulatory), dataset author has already done the cartography upstream, many categories (>12) where a palette would cycle meaninglessly.

**Don't use when:** column name suggests colours but doesn't contain hex strings (verify first), user wants cartographic control (colorblind / luminance / palette rotation), continuous numeric measures.

**Layer-type caveat:** reliable on `tileset` (every row reaches the renderer unchanged). On `h3` / `quadbin` the color column must propagate through the spatial-index aggregation expression, which the CLI doesn't auto-handle — prefer tileset or pre-aggregate manually.

---

## 5. Basemap pairing

> **Set basemap in BOTH** `keplerMapConfig.config.basemapConfig.styleId` AND `keplerMapConfig.config.mapStyle.styleType` to the same value. See [`basemap.md`](basemap.md) for the dual-write rule and id catalogue.

```
Thematic data (choropleth, cells, density)
└── positron (light) or dark-matter (dark) — minimal basemap, max data prominence

Reference data (points on top of city context)
└── voyager — keeps road/label/POI context without overwhelming

Photo-real raster (satellite, NDVI composite)
└── positron under it (reference grid) or no basemap

Real-world high-zoom context (delivery, indoor, ops)
└── Google satellite or hybrid
```

**Default when in doubt: `positron`.** Neutral, doesn't fight the data, works with every palette family.

**Layer-group toggles** (`basemapConfig.visibleLayerGroups`, mirror in `mapStyle.visibleLayerGroups`): clean thematic view → off: `road`, `border`, `label`; on: `land`, `water`, `building`. Reference map → keep everything on. Print → off `building` at low zoom, off `label` when the thematic layer carries text.

---

## 6. Legend, popup, label

### 6.1 Legend

Auto-generated per layer unless suppressed. Type inferred from `colorScale`:

- `quantile` / `quantize` / `custom` → binned with range labels
- `ordinal` → categorical
- `custom` + `logarithmic` → binned with exponential labels

**When to suppress** (`config.legend.isHidden: true`):
- Reference backdrop layer (light gray admin polygons under points).
- Two layers encode the same measure (suppress the duplicate).
- An external widget already shows the distribution.

**Never suppress** the primary choropleth legend — the map is illegible without it.

**Legend entry order — bake into the configuration.** For CLI-authored maps, the legend's visible order is dictated by config, not the UI:

| `colorScale` | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| `custom` (categorical `colorMap`) | The order of entries IS the legend order — author intentionally |
| `custom` (numeric breaks) | Ascending key order — emit sorted |
| `ordinal` | Set `visualChannels.colorDomain: [...]` explicitly. If absent, Builder derives from data (non-deterministic for CLI maps) |
| `quantize` / `quantile` | Always low→high; not author-controllable except via class count |

### 6.2 Popup (hover + click)

> **Popups are load-bearing whenever the unit of insight is the individual feature, not the aggregate pattern.** A choropleth without popups answers *"where is it concentrated?"* and stops. Add popups and the same map answers *"what is this store's revenue?"*. Default to emitting popups whenever the dataset has feature-identifying columns (name, id, address, owner, timestamp). Skip on pure pattern maps (heatmap, density) or public presentation-only maps.

`popupStyle`: `light`, `lightWithHiFirst`, `dark`, `darkWithHiFirst`, `panel`, `none`.

**Rules:**
- **Hover popup:** capped at 5 columns by the CLI. Prefer 2–4.
- **Click popup:** no hard cap. Scope by relevance — don't dump 30 columns.
- **Style:** `light` on positron/voyager, `dark` on dark-matter. `WithHiFirst` promotes the hovered field to the top.
- **`panel`** docks the popup to a side panel — choose for dense detail or mobile-portrait.
- **`none`** — pure presentation maps only.

### 6.3 Labels (textLabel)

`config.textLabel` (an array of label configs) applies to **vector tileset layers only** — point, line, and polygon. It is *not* available on aggregation/cell layers (h3, quadbin, heatmap) or raster; `clusterTile` has its own separate count label, not `textLabel`. On the layers that support it, set `textLabel[0].field` to the column to draw and the renderer anchors the label to the feature automatically — the point itself for points, the **midpoint** for lines, the **centroid** for polygons. No centroid/point column is required; deck.gl synthesises the anchor from the feature geometry.

Labels render at every zoom the layer is visible. There is no per-label zoom gate — **control label density upstream** by choosing a sparse field (major cities, HQ locations), not a dense one (every store).

**Use for:** named features the viewer won't recognise from position; polygons where the name is meaningful (counties, neighbourhoods) and density is OK; lines where the name matters (major roads, rivers, transit lines, boundaries); small hand-curated reference layers.

**Don't use for:** dense point datasets, cell/aggregation layers (h3, quadbin, heatmap — no natural anchor, no label support), rasters.

**One label per line feature (`textLabelUniqueIdField`) — lines only.** A line usually spans several tiles, and by default each tile draws its own copy of the label, so a long road shows its name repeated. Set `visConfig.textLabelUniqueIdField` to a column that uniquely identifies each line feature (e.g. `name`, `road_id`) and the renderer collapses it to a single label per feature. Builder exposes this control **only for line-geometry layers** — it's the knob that makes road/river/boundary labelling look right. Points and polygons don't take it.

**Legibility defaults:**
- `outlineColor`: inverse of basemap background (white on dark, near-black on light).
- `size`: 12–14 max; 16+ shouts.
- `anchor` / `alignment`: these (plus `size`) are what actually position the label relative to its anchor point. **`offset` is ignored for tile-layer labels** — don't rely on it for placement.

### 6.4 Description (right-rail markdown)

The map's `description` field is **optional**. When empty, the right-rail info button is hidden entirely (the viewer sees nothing), and that's a fine outcome for reference layers or maps with no real story. But when there *is* a story — a pattern in the data, a distinctive basemap, an interaction worth nudging — **go rich**. The right rail has plenty of vertical room, and a well-built description reads like a small landing page for the map.

Treat it as a note to the end-user viewing the map — what they should take away, why it's interesting, and what to try next. Not authoring notes, not change history, not a spec sheet.

**Template — top to bottom:**

| Slot | Content |
|---|---|
| Hero image *(optional, encouraged for place-based or cartography maps)* | `![alt](url)` above the title. Anchors the right rail and gives the description landing-page feel |
| `## Title` | The map's hook — the framing the viewer should read everything else through |
| Lead paragraph | 2–4 sentences. What the map shows, why the dataset matters, the pattern the viewer is meant to notice |
| `### Context` *(optional, rename per map)* | One short paragraph on the basemap, the source dataset's backstory, or a related layer that frames the main one. E.g. `### The basemap — Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles` |
| `### What you are looking at` | Bullets that map visual channels → data fields with narrative gloss (palette rationale, units, exaggeration factor, filter axes, data FQN). Restating the legend is fine here — the value is the gloss |
| `### Things to try` *(only if interactive)* | 2–4 bullets — concrete filter combinations, zoom levels, camera angles, or widget settings that pay off |

No standalone `### Source` section — connection / table identifiers are author-side plumbing. If the dataset name is part of the story, fold it into the lead paragraph as a code span or include it as one bullet inside `### What you are looking at`.

**Length — no hard cap.** As long as every section earns its space, fill the right rail. A reference layer might warrant zero lines; a flagship analytical or cartography map can comfortably run 20+.

**No tables, but images are fine.** The renderer supports headings, paragraphs, lists, and embedded images — but not table syntax. For data callouts (top-N, before/after, comparisons) embed a small image instead of bullet-padding in lieu of a table.

**Anti-pattern — a hand-written legend in the description.** The map already has one, it updates itself, and it carries the actual swatches. A `### Reading the map` list restating *red means X, dashed means Y* duplicates it, goes stale the moment styling changes, and burns the right rail on something the viewer can already see. Write why the encoding was chosen, not what each symbol maps to: *"hatching marks ground where a rule applies, which is why those areas pull the eye"* earns its space; *"red cross hatch = bus only"* does not.

**Anti-pattern — boilerplate that doesn't add narrative.** *"This map shows three layers, displayed at different zoom levels"* tells the viewer nothing. Restating channel→field mappings is fine when you're adding context (palette rationale, units, exaggeration factor); it's noise when you're just naming the legend swatches.

**Worked example — Manhattan PLUTO on Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles:**

````markdown
![New York City skyline](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496442226666-8d4d0e62e6e9?w=1600&q=80)

## Manhattan, in 3D

Every building footprint in Manhattan from the **NYC PLUTO** dataset (~40k records), extruded by floor count and coloured by land use. Mixed-use streetwalls, multi-family elevator blocks, and the commercial spine of Midtown reveal themselves as soon as you tilt the camera.

### The basemap — Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles

Underneath the PLUTO extrusions sits Google's **Photorealistic 3D Tiles**: a global, streamed mesh of real cities reconstructed from satellite and aerial imagery. CARTO renders it as the `google-3d` basemap, giving you real terrain, rooftops and street-level detail at any pitch. Tilt the map (`Cmd + drag`) and the city itself becomes the canvas.

### What you are looking at

- **Color** — Land use (12 NYC PLUTO categories, fluorescent palette tuned for the dark backdrop)
- **Height** — `numfloors`, exaggerated 3× for emphasis
- **Filters** — Use the *Land use* and *Era* widgets to slice by category or decade
- **Data** — `carto-demo-data.demo_tables.manhattan_pluto_data`

### Things to try

- Filter to **Pre-1900** buildings — watch SoHo and Greenwich Village light up
- Flip the Era widget to **2000+** to pick out every modern tower on the skyline
- Pan north and follow the residential walk-ups (peach) into the elevator-served forest

## 7. Anti-patterns — do not emit these

### 7.1 Rainbow ramps on sequential data
`Prism`, `Vivid` lack luminance ordering — the eye can't tell which value is higher. Keep them for categorical only.

### 7.2 Sequential palette on signed data
A measure that crosses zero (change, delta, over/under target) on a sequential palette loses the sign. Always diverging for signed (§4.3 for centring).

### 7.3 3D extrusion where it doesn't belong
Supported only on polygon tilesets, h3, quadbin. Points and rasters have no extrudable surface. Extrusion reads as *magnitude* — honest for counts/totals/population; misleading for rates/percentages/shares/densities. Extrude counts by default; if extruding a rate, label the legend unambiguously.

### 7.4 Too many classes
Past ~7 classes on a sequential ramp the eye can't pair ramp position with legend bin. Cap at 7; default 5.

### 7.5 Red/green as the only encoding
~8% of men have deuteranopia / protanopia — red and green collapse to the same yellow-brown. **Fix:** blue-red diverging (`Temps`, `Tropic`) or `TealRose`. If the design requires red/green, pair with shape/icon as redundant encoding.

### 7.6 Quantile on bimodal distributions
Quantile assumes unimodal. Bimodal data gets chopped into classes that match neither mode. Pull a histogram before committing; if bimodal, switch to `custom` with breakpoints at the modes, or `quantize` to keep modes separated.

### 7.7 Opacity as a data channel
Opacity entangles with overlap — two faint points look like one solid. Reserve `opacity` as a global dimmer (0.6–0.9), not per-feature encoding.

### 7.8 Sequential / diverging on a string column
String columns → **qualitative palette, distinct hues.** Sequential implies *more in one direction*; diverging implies a midpoint. String values rarely carry either reliably. Default to qualitative; the rare exception (truly ordered strings like grades A–F) is documented in §3.5 — but unless the user names that ordering explicitly, qualitative is right.

### 7.9 Encoding the same column twice
Color + height driven by the same column is redundant. One column per channel.

### 7.10 Palette reflex across sessions
If the previous session ended on a given palette, **don't reach for it again**. The fit that worked once is rarely the fit for a different narrative. Re-derive each map from the family principle (§4) — the answer may legitimately be the same palette, but it should be a fresh fit, not a reach. Common reflex traps: defaulting to thermal-warm palettes on non-thermal data, or to a single sequential ramp regardless of basemap tone.

**Escape hatch:** if the user explicitly asks for a consistent palette across a series (dashboards, before/after), fixed palette is correct.

### 7.11 Multi-layer mono-culture within one map
Each layer must be visually distinguishable from every other at a glance. **Palette-family-per-layer, not shades-of-one.** Three rings at alpha 0.2 / 0.35 / 0.5 in the same colour read as overlap shading, not discrete layers. Pick independent families per layer (one warm, one cool, one neutral).

**Disambiguate nested-with-shared-encoding from independent overlays.** Drive-time isochrones at 5/10/15 min are *one logical layer* (one ramp) — single sequential, lightest outside, correct. Three independent catchments are *three layers* — distinct families.

**Sanity check before emit:** if two layers share `visConfig.colorRange.colors[]` (data-driven) or `config.color` (solid-fill), refit.

### 7.12 Point overplotting at low zoom
Always-visible point `tileset` with no `visibilityByZoom` and no aggregated companion → silent failure (validates, creates, only fails on open). Author the fix up front per §1.9.

### 7.13 Contrasting stroke on dense choropleths
Dense small-polygon choropleths (sub-national admin, postcodes, parcels, h3 / quadbin cells) with default contrasting stroke make boundaries more prominent than the data. **Fix:** derive `strokeColorField` from the same column as the fill, darker variant of fill palette, same break points. Recipe in §1.3. Contrasting stroke is correct only on *large few* polygons (countries on a world map).

---

## 8. Worked recipes

Three archetypal recipes. Every field name is real. Widget composition is out of scope.

### 8.1 Store revenue change YoY by postcode (signed diverging)

- Data: polygon tileset, numeric `revenue_change_pct` (signed, centred ≈0).
- Layer: `tileset` (polygon — source-fixed).
- Classification: `custom` with colorMap pinning 0 at palette centre.
- Channel: `colorField: "revenue_change_pct"`.
- Classes: 7 (nuance both sides of zero).
- Palette: diverging from the colorblind-safe subset (e.g. `TealRose` or `Temps`) — re-fit each time per §4.
- Basemap: `positron`.
- Legend: on, percentage format.
- Popup: hover `postcode` + `revenue_change_pct`; click full breakdown.

### 8.2 Bike-share trip density (point aggregation)

- Data: point source, ~2M rows, no pre-aggregation.
- Layer: **agent choice** (§1.0) — aggregate to `h3` (density question, quantitative reading wanted).
- Aggregation: `colorAggregation: "count"`.
- Resolution: h3 res 8 (city scale).
- Classification: `custom` + log10 if counts span 4+ orders, else `quantile`.
- Channel: `colorField` on cell count.
- Classes: 5.
- Palette: sequential cool from §4.1, fit to basemap tone.
- Basemap: `positron`.
- Legend: on — cells carry real numbers.
- Popup: hover cell total; click top start-stations in the cell.

*When to pick `heatmapTile` instead:* only if the deliverable is explicitly a wide-zoom narrative glow and no one reads the legend.

### 8.3 Brand-coloured stores (hex column)

- Data: point tileset, each row has `brand_name` (string) + `brand_hex` (hex string).
- Layer: `tileset` (point, source-fixed).
- Mode: **hexColor** — data carries its own colors (§4.7).
- Channel: `colorField: { name: "brand_name", colorColumn: "brand_hex" }`, `colorScale: "ordinal"`.
- Palette: `{ hexColor: true, name: "Custom", category: "Custom", type: "custom", colors: [] }` — runtime fills from the column.
- Basemap: `positron`.
- Legend: on — one row per brand, coloured by hex.
- Popup: hover `brand_name`; click adds store-specific fields.

*Why this over a `Bold` palette:* brand colours are contractual, not aesthetic.

## 9. Checklist before handing off

Walk this list before emit. If any answer is *"no"* or *"unsure"*, fix it or note it to the user.

- [ ] Layer type respects the source — only point sources are agent-choice (§1, §1.0).
- [ ] For point sources, aggregation defaults to `h3` over `heatmapTile` / `clusterTile` when quantitative reading matters (§1.0).
- [ ] Primary channel is color unless there's a specific reason otherwise (§2.1).
- [ ] Attribution matches the geometry — point fields on points, line on lines, polygon on polygons (§1.1–§1.3).
- [ ] Scale type matches data shape AND meaning: `quantize` + `colorDomain` for bounded with semantic landmarks; `custom` + log10 for heavy-tailed; `quantile` only for skewed-unbounded where viewers want rank; cast-to-STRING + `ordinal` for categorical-looking integers; `custom` colorMap for stakeholder-agreed breaks (§3.2). **`quantile` is NOT the safe default.**
- [ ] **Palette family matches measure character.** Sequential for magnitude, diverging for signed, qualitative for categorical (§4). String columns → qualitative (§7.8). If uncertain on the specific palette: `Teal` (sequential), `Temps` / `Geyser` (diverging), `Bold` / `Safe` (qualitative) — see §4.2 defaults.
- [ ] Palette is a fresh fit per map — not a reflex from the prior session (§7.10).
- [ ] Palette is colorblind-safe if audience is public or unknown (§4.1).
- [ ] Palette is named exactly as the runtime knows it, or built via the borrow pattern (§4.6).
- [ ] Basemap pairs with palette luminance (§4.4, §5).
- [ ] Class count is 3–7, default 5 (§3.4).
- [ ] 3D extrusion only on supported layers (polygon, h3, quadbin); default to counts/totals; if extruding a rate, label the legend unambiguously so the height isn't read as quantity (§7.3).
- [ ] **Zoom strategy** for point and multi-granularity layers — `visibilityByZoom: { min: ≥7, max: 24 }` or a low-zoom aggregation companion. Multi-granularity polygon data: per-level cascade. Don't ship an always-visible point tileset over a national/global dataset (§1.9, §7.12).
- [ ] No rainbow palette on a sequential measure (§7.1).
- [ ] Hover popup 2–4 columns (cap 5); click popup scoped by relevance (§6.2).
- [ ] Label field is sparse enough that labels don't collide — no per-label zoom gate (§6.3).
- [ ] **Description is optional** — empty is fine when there's no story. When emitted, go rich: optional hero image → `## Title` → lead paragraph → optional `### Context` / `### What you are looking at` / `### Things to try`. No standalone `### Source` section. No tables. No hard length cap (§6.4).
- [ ] One column per channel (§7.9).
- [ ] Multi-layer maps use distinct palette families, not shades of one (§7.11).
